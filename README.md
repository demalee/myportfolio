Hello, I'm Wilson Kibet. My career is a journey through the full spectrum of software creation. From writing code as a Full-Stack Developer, to ensuring reliability as a DevOps practitioner, to guiding teams as a Technical Lead, I've built a comprehensive understanding of what makes digital products succeed. Now, as a Senior Solutions Architect at Safaricom PLC, I synthesize these experiences into a single mission: transforming visionary ideas into reliable, scalable, and user-centric digital foundations.

I architect the systems, champion the processes, and mentor the teams that turn complex challenges into elegant software.
